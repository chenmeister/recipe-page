## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

For this project, I further refined my CSS skills and learned how to reduce duplications in CSS files. Learning how to set the markers to a different color seemed tricky at first but with some guidance from w3schools, I was able to do it. 

### Continued development

What I plan to do is to further refine the CSS used just so its maintainable and reusable.
